# Shopping Cart Application

A simple shopping cart built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Users can add, update, and remove products from the cart. The cart state persists across page reloads using **localStorage**.

## Features

- **Product List**: Displays a list of products.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their cart.
- **Update Cart**: Users can update the quantity of items in the cart or remove them.
- **Cart Persistence**: Cart data is saved to localStorage to persist after a page refresh.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the user interface.

## Technologies

- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplified state management for the shopping cart.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **localStorage**: To save and load cart data after a page reload.
